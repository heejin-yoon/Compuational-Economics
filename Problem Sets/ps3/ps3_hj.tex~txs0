	\item The value function over the possible asset choices for the age of 50 is drawn below. The value function is increasing and concave.

	\item The savings function for the age of 20 is illustrated as follows.  function over the possible asset choices for the age of 50 is drawn below. The value function is increasing and concave. The laws of motions for savings differ by $z$. For $z_{High}$, saving is decreasing in $a$ until the retirement, but increasing after the retirement. For $z_{Low}$, saving is always increasing in $a$, regardless of whether the agent is working or not.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] After eliminating social security, aggregate capital increases from $3.348$ to $4.604$, because households save more in their working ages for the life after retirement. Aggregate labor also increases (from $0.341$ to $0.364$), because labor tax ($\theta$) is removed. The economy-wide welfare decreases from $-35.8$ to $-37.3$ and overall inequality measured by the coefficient of variation of wealth increases (from $0.598$ to $0.673$).
	
	\item[2.] Without idiosyncratic risk (i.e., $z_{High} = z_{Low} = 0.5$), aggregate capital decreases from $3.348$ to $1.078$. This is because households have no motivation to insure against idiosyncratic income risks. After the removal of social security again, the economy-wide welfare slightly decreases from $-44.9$ to $-45.2$. Given that the absolute amount of decrease is far less than that of the benchmark, we can conclude that social security serve the role of an insurance device against idiosyncratic risk. However, it should be noted that the welfare comparisons across steady states could be misleading, because the impact of reform during the transition period is ignored. 
	
	\item[2.] Finally, we consider exogenous labor supply case. We can see aggregate labor is $0.753$, indicating all agents in their working ages provide 1 unit of labor. Since labor supply is exogenously determined, social security system has no distortionary effect on labor supply. Still, aggregate welfare decreases when social security is eliminated, leading us to the same conclusion as before.
